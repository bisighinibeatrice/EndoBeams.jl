### **Boundary Conditions and Loads**

Currently, the system supports two types of **boundary conditions**: 
- **Encastre** (where the degrees of freedom are fixed)
- **Time-dependent displacements** (where displacements change over time).

For **loads**, the system currently supports only **time-dependent concentrated forces**.

✔️ If no loads are applied to the structure, you can pass `nothing` for the loads argument in the `Configuration` structure. 

✔️ However, even in the absence of boundary conditions, you must still pass a `BoundaryConditions` structure. This structure should include only the **total number of DOFs** in the system. This is necessary to generate the `free_dofs`, which are used later in the code.

**Future Improvements:**
- Implement automatic handling of empty boundary conditions: if `nothing` is passed for the boundary conditions in the `Configuration` structure, the system will automatically create only the free DOFs in the backend (without requiring input from the user).
- Expand support for different types of loads beyond just concentrated forces.

### **Extra**

**To Be Fixed:**
- Energy computation: Determine whether energy should be associated directly with the configuration.
- When reading VTK files, **CELL-TYPES** need to be removed manually now.
